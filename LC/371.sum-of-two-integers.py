# Calculate the sum of two integers a and b, but you are not allowed to use the
# operator + and -.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: a = 1, b = 2
# Output: 3
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: a = -2, b = 3
# Output: 1

        # in Python, every integer is associated with its two's complement and its sign.
        # However, doing bit operation "& mask" loses the track of sign. 
        # Therefore, after the while loop, a is the two's complement of the final result as a 32-bit unsigned integer. 
        while b != 0:
            a, b = (a ^ b) & mask, ((a & b) << 1) & mask

        # a is negative if the first bit is 1
