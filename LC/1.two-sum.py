# used as a sample question in 
# How to: Work at Google â€” Example Coding/Engineering Interview
# the last question, what if the list is huge which can't put in memory
# the guy asked the right question, can the comp list put in memory?
# if yes, the input list can be chunked into smaller part
# either processed one by one or in parallel, for each chunk, do the same

# in the following 4 solutions, the 4th is brute force, the other 3 are the
# same, single pass hash

class Solution:
