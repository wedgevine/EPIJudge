CLRS is quite 'academic' and requires good understanding of mathematics. It's a great book, but not a good one for beginners, imo. It will be difficult as self study for first timers. You can start with Datastructures and Algorithm Analysis in C by M. A. Weiss[0]. One more alternative is The Algorithm Design Manual by S. Skiena[1]. It's also good and focuses more on algorithm, implementation (as opposed to math-y stuff of CLRS). If I were you, I would get both the books and read alternatively. Don't miss out on exercises, they are very important.
I also suggest you to join this Coursera course, Algorithms: Design and Analysis by Tim Roughgarden[2]. Currently the course is open, so you can sign up for classes. The course is offered in two parts[3], complete both of them.

Once you are comfortable with basic concepts start solving questions/puzzles online on sites like SPOJ[4], UVa[5], (YC-funded) HackerRank[6]. You could try TopCoder[7] also, but the questions are bit difficult. Hope this helps.

PS - You should study math, because it is important in Algorithms Analysis. You could try reading required parts of Concrete Mathematics by Knuth[8] or as you come across new concepts, Google and understand them.
