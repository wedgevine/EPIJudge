## tip
* sentinel, a special dummy node to make the singly/doubly list circular, for easier deletion and insertion  
  there is no need to check None for head/tail node, there is always a sentinel node existed.

* don't fotget to update next for head or tail
* like two pointers in array, linked list has two iterators algo, one slow and one fast, one front and one behind 
* when update the list while traversing, be careful with iter and iter.next, change iter.next then let iter = iter.next
* python has no direct implementation for linked list, implement by yourself

## problem
1. EPI7.1 Merge two sorted lists  
   *Given two sorted lists, merge them into one list*
   ***
   keep two pointers, head and tail, let tail move with L1 and L2
1. EPI7.2/LC92 Reverse a singe sublist
   *Given a linked list, int s and f, reverse sublist from s-th node to f-th node, node starts from 1*
   ***
   idea drawing from LC https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list-ii/discuss/30709/Talk-is-cheap-show-me-the-code-(and-DRAWING)
   1. create dummy node pointing the head node
   1. locate the start node and pre_start, next_start nodes
   2. from next_start to end node, remove the node, insert it after the pre_start node
   3. done
1. LC206 Reverse a whole singly linked list  
   *Reverse a linked list either iteratively or recursively*
   ***
   thinking about changing pointer directions, starting from the head
1. EPI7.3 Is list cyclic  
   *Given a linked list, find out if it is cyclic, if yes, return the start node*
   ***
   two pointers, one slow, and one fast, if it is cyclic, fast must equals slow at a time  
   if there is cycle, start from any node, find out cycle length  
   let fast ahead of slow pointer by cycle length, when they met, they met at the start node
1. EPI7.4 Testing for overlapping, lists are cycle-free  
   *Given two cycle-free singly linked list, determine if they share common node and return the first overlapping node*
   ***
   1. for each list, traverse to the last node, compare to see if they are the same
   2. also record list length, get the delta, let the longer list start delta first
   3. in the second pass, compare two iterator to see if they pointing to the same node
1. EPI7.5 Testing for overlapping, lists may have cycles  
   *Same as above, but lists may have cycles*
   ***
   1. find out cyclic of each list
   2. if both are cycle-free, same as above
   3. if both have cycles, get the cycle-entering node for each list, using slow-fast method to check if they are in the same cycle, if yes, there are two case
   4. if shared node is outside cycle, using delta to find out
   5. if shared node is inside cycle, return any cycle-entering node
   6. helper functions, get_cyclic_node, get_distance_between_two_node
1. EPI7.6 Delete node from a singly linked list  
   *Using O(1) time*
   ***
   if allowing copy data from one node to another node, for given node to be deleted, copy
   its successor's data to itself, then change next to its successor's next
1. EPI7.7 Remove kth last element  
   *Suppose don't know the list length*
   ***
   two pointers, fast is ahead of slow one by k elements, when fast hit the tail, make sure the slow one just pointing the one before the kth
1. EPI7.8 Remove duplicates from the sorted list  
   *Given a sorted singly linked list, delete duplicates from it*
   ***
   keep two pointers, one pointing the first node for all possible nodes share the same value, another iterate the list, when new value encountered, skip all nodes between
   these two and assign current node to first pointer
1. EPI7.9 Cyclic right shift  
   *Given singly linked list and nonnegative int k, shift all nodes to the right by k*
   ***
   corner case, list is not empty, list length module k is not zero
   the find out the break point of the link, break it and add the sublist to the head
   or make the list a cycle first, then just break it at the break point
1. EPI7.10 Even-Odd merge  
   *Given a list, return a list so that even-numbered nodes are in the front*
   ***
   no need for extra space, thinking about two lists, one for even and one for odd, traverse
   the original list, append even nodes to even list, odd nodes to odd list, at the end, connect these two lists.  
   a very important characteristic of linked list is links can be broke and connect as needed, just changing pointers, so multiple lists don't need more space  
   just be careful with what should be pointed and changed for "next"
1. EPI7.11 Test whether a singly linked list palindromic  
   *It is easier for array*
   ***
   but list can only be traversed in one direction, so we need to find the middle point of
   the list, reverse half of the list, then traverse these two half lists to compare.  
   but this method changed the list, is it possible to change it back when comparising?
1. EPI7.12 List pivoting  
   *Given a list and int k, move all nodes less than k to the front, equal nodes in the middle and larger nodes in the rear*
   ***
   same as even-odd merge, keep three sublists, one for from, one for middle and one for rear, just need to be careful with head/tail/next/None and corner cases
1. EPI7.13 Add list-based integers  
   *Given two lists representing two integers, least significant digit coming first, return there sum in list representation*
   ***
   using space of existing lists, keep record for carry-on digit, adding while traversing  
   if most significant digit comes first, then may need to reverse the lists first
