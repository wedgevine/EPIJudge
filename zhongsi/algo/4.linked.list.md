* singly linked list, node (data, next), head/tail node
* doubly linked list, node (data, pre, next)
* get kth element in the list is expensive, O(N) time complexity
* insert and delete are O(1) time complexity
  
prototype
```
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, data=0, next_node=None):
        self.data = data
        self.next_node = next_node
```

basic list apis
```
def search_list(L, key):
    while L and L.data != key:
        L = L.next_node
    return L

def insert_after(node, data):
    new_node = ListNode(data, node.next_node)
    node.next_node = new_node

def delete_after(node):
    # suppose node.next_node != null
    node.next_node = node.next_node.next_node
```

## tip
* sentinel, a special dummy node to make the singly/doubly list circular, for easier deletion and insertion  
  there is no need to check None for head/tail node, there is always a sentinel node existed.
* don't fotget to update next for head or tail
* like two pointers in array, linked list has two iterators algo, one slow and one fast, one front and one behind 
* python has no direct implementation for linked list, implement by yourself

## problem
1. EPI7.1 Merge two sorted lists  
   *Given two sorted lists, merge them into one list*
   ***

1. EPI7.2 Reverse a singe sublist
   *Given a linked list, int s and f, reverse sublist from s-th node to f-th node, node starts from 1*
