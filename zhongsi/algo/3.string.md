## problem
1. EPI6.1 Convert between string and int  
   *convert from string to int and from int to string*
   ***
   string to int, read one digit a time, multiple 10 for existing and add the new digit  
   int to string, need an array for all the digit, module to get the ones digit and divide the existing by 10  
   corner case, negative and zero
1. EPI6.2 Base conversion  
   *convert string in base b1 to string in base b2*
   ***
   read the string in b1 base into a integer in decimal, convert the decimal into b2 base string
1. EPI6.3 Compute spreadsheet column encoding  
1. *change int to spreadsheet encoding like 'AA', 'ZZZ'*
   ***
   base 26 encoding, using digit A, B, C, .., Z
   all the above involves place value(positional notation, 位值记数法), also chr() and ord() functions
1. EPI6.4 Replace and remove  
   *given string s and int size, replce 'a' with 2 'd' and remove 'b' for all first size chars of the string, return the processed string length*
   ***
   if the string has no 'a' or 'b', nothing need to be done, if just has 'a', just increase the string, if just has 'b', decrease the string
   the solution is combine both methods, first iteration forward to delete all 'b', then iteration backward to replace all 'a' with 2 'd's.
   this forward scan and figure out final size technique also can be used in telex encoding problem, that is, a string of letters, numbers and marks,
   need to encoding marks of the string, like '.' with 'DOT', ',' with 'COMMA', etc. the idea is iterate forward to figure out the final size and
   copy/encode the string from end
1. EPI6.5/LC125 Test Palindromicity  
   *given a string, with all nonalphanumeric removed, test if it is palindromic*
   ***
   two pointers, one from head, another from tail, use function isalnum and lower
1. LC9 Palindrome number  
   *determined weather an int is a palindrome*
   ***
   reverse the int and compare value, negative is not 
1. LC680 Valid Palindrome II  
   *given a non-empty string, may delete at most one char, judge weather you can make is palindrome*
   ***
   two pointers, also record the first difference (head, tail positions), try skip head or tail to see if it is palindrome
   or recursive solution, create function is_palindrome(s) like in simple palindrome, then
   in main loop, if s[head] != s[tail], try is_palindrome(s[head+1 : tail+1]) and is_palindrome(s[head : tail])  
1. EPI6.6 Reverse words of string  
   *Given a string of words sperated by whitespace, transfer the string that words are in reverse order*
   ***
   like "Replace and remove", two passes are needed, first reverse the string, second reverse each word
1. EPI6.7 Compute all mnemonics for all phone numbers
   *Given a string of int as phone number, returns all words corresponding to the phone number*
   ***
   recursive.
   ```
   get_word(digit)
    if digit == len(phone_number) # join all letters
    else:
        for c in MAPPING[int(phone_number[digit])]:
            word[digit] = c
            get_word(digit + 1)

   get_word(0)
   ```
   how about non-recursive algo?
1. EPI6.8 The look and say problem
   *Given a int n, return n-th look and say sequence in string, like  1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, ...*
   ***
   scan the string from left to right, each time check current and next char, to determine if need to write to result.
   itertools.groupby() is more pythonic.
   ```
    s = '1'
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        s = ''.join(
            str(len(list(group))) + key for key, group in itertools.groupby(s)
        ) 
   ```
1. EPI6.9 Convert from roman to decimal  
   *Given a valid roman number in string, the format is simplified and symbols are in nonincreasing order, return its value in decimal*
   ***
   to utilize the nonincreasing order, instead of scanning the string from left to right, scan it from right, normally the symbol should
   increase, if we find a decreased symbol, it means we found a pair, functools.reduce() could be used to get the final value
   ```
       return functools.reduce(
        lambda x, i: x + (-MAPPING[s[i]] if MAPPING[s[i]] < MAPPING[s[i + 1]] else MAPPING[s[i]]),
        reversed(range(len(s) - 1)),
        MAPPING[s[-1]]
    )
   ```
1. EPI6.10 Valid IPv4 address  
   *Given a decimal string with dots are missing, list all possible valid IPv4 strings*
   ***
   book has a 4 nested loop solution, we used a recursive solution, just need to treat '0' specifically, since '01' is not a valid ip address part.
   for unbounded string and number of period, recursive solution looks better.
   LC has more complicated/similar question
1. EPI6.11 Snake string  
   *Given a string, write the string in sinusoidal fashion, the snakestring is the left-right, top-to-bottom sequence, return it*
   ***
   find the patter for top, middle, bottom lines, python slicing is the way
   ```
   return s[1::4] + s[0::2] + s[3::4]
   ```
1. EPI6.12 String run length compression encoding and decoding, that is, encode successive repeated chars by the repetition count and char  
   *Implement an encoding and decoding solutions*
   ***
   use helping array for final result string, ''.join(result)
   encoding: scan the string, look ahead, append to array  
   decoding: scan the string, using the same method as string to int to calculate char count, append to array
1. EPI6.13 Substring matching  
   *Given text t and pattern s, find the first index that s is a substring of t*
   ***
   claasic string matching problem, brute-force, and rabin-karp using hash function/rolling hash, kmp using preprocessed next array
   in red book and alogrithms book
