
* chr() function convert integer to char, chr(ord('0') + i)
* ord() function convert char to integer, ord(c) - ord('0')

## problem
1. EPI6.1 Convert between string and int  
   *convert from string to int and from int to string*
   ***
   string to int, read one digit a time, multiple 10 for existing and add the new digit  
   int to string, need an array for all the digit, module to get the ones digit and divide the existing by 10  
   corner case, negative and zero
1. EPI6.2 Base conversion  
   *convert string in base b1 to string in base b2*
   ***
   read the string in b1 base into a integer in decimal, convert the decimal into b2 base string
1. EPI6.3 Compute spreadsheet column encoding  
1. *change int to spreadsheet encoding like 'AA', 'ZZZ'*
   ***
   base 26 encoding, using digit A, B, C, .., Z
   all the above involves place value(positional notation, 位值记数法), also chr() and ord() functions
1. EPI6.4 Replace and remove  
   *given string s and int size, replce 'a' with 2 'd' and remove 'b' for all first size chars of the string, return the processed string length*
   ***
   if the string has no 'a' or 'b', nothing need to be done, if just has 'a', just increase the string, if just has 'b', decrease the string
   the solution is combine both methods, first iteration forward to delete all 'b', then iteration backward to replace all 'a' with 2 'd's.
   this forward scan and figure out final size technique also can be used in telex encoding problem, that is, a string of letters, numbers and marks,
   need to encoding marks of the string, like '.' with 'DOT', ',' with 'COMMA', etc. the idea is iterate forward to figure out the final size and
   copy/encode the string from end
