stack: last in first out LIFO, push, pop, peek
python stack can be implemented by list, append() for push, pop() for pop, len() for length

queue: first in first out FIFO


## tip

## problem
1. EPI8.6 Compute binary tree nodes in order of depth  
   *For given binary tree, return a list of keys at the same level, from left to right*
   ***
   using an array (as a queue), from root, load current level's nodes from left to right into the queue,
   get their keys, then clear the queue, load next level (from left to right) until there is no node in 
   current level.  
   list comprehension was used when generating next level node list from parent nodes:  
   node_list = [child for node in node_list for child in [node.left, node.right] if child]  
   there are many variants of the issue
   * return the keys in top-down manner, from left to right or right to left, same as above?
   * return the keys in bottom-up manner, left to right order, using a stack for top-down, then pop?
   * return the average of keys at each level, same as the main problem?
