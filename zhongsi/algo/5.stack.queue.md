stack: last in first out LIFO, push, pop, peek
python stack can be implemented by list 
* append() for push
* pop() for pop
* len() for length, len(list) == 0 to test if the stack is empty
* list[-1] retrieve the top element of the stack

queue: first in first out FIFO, enqueue, dequeue  
queue can be implemented using linked list (with head/tail pointers) 
or array (EPI8.7 a circular queue)
python has built-in queue implementation, deque, collections.deque  
it is a double-ended queue, implemented by doubly linked list
* enqueue is implemented by append()
* dequeue is implemented by popleft()
* q[0], q[-1] will retrieve (not remove) first/last element
* dequeing or access the head/tail of an empty queue will raise IndexError exception  

queue FIFO is used when order need to be preserved


## tip
* EPI8.1 and EPI8.5 both used collections.namedtuple as simple/immutable container class/struct.
  like ElementWithMax, BuildingWithHeight, which are just like tuple, field can be referenced
  by name and index, also it provides factory function for easy object creation


## problem
1. EPI8.1 Implement a stack with max API  
   *in addition to pop and push, implement max method*
   ***
   to avoid the O(N) time complexity when doing pop(), save an additional value max for each element
   in the stack, the max denotes the max value for all elements beneath or equal the current element,
   so there is no need to traverse all elements when pop an element, just check the max field for current
   element. trade space for speed
1. EPI8.2 Evaluate RPN expression  
   *take RPN expression and return the number it evaluates to*
   ***
   * prefix notation, polish notation, +12
   * infix expression, 1+2
   * postfix notation, reverse polish notation, 12-
   where prefix and postfix expressions can be evaluated by stack.
   lambda can be used to represent the action need to be taken when encounter operator +-*/ 
1. EPI8.3 Test a string over '(){}[]' for well-formedness  
   ***
   using a stack, when left parentheis comes in, push, when right parenthesis comes, if match with
   top element, pop, or return False
1. EPI8.4 Normalize pathnames  
   *Given a pathname, return the shortest pathname, subdirectory name maybe /, ., ..*
   ***
   using a stack, split the input by '/', ignore ., for alnum subdirectory name, push, for '..', unless
   the top is also '..', pop. be careful with corner cases, like keep the starting '/'.
1. EPI8.5 Compute building with sunset view  
   *Given a series building facing west, any building to the east of a building with same or greater height
   can't see the sunset, return an array of set of building which can see the sunset*
   ***
   using a stack for all candidate buldings, when new building comes in, pop all buldings in the stack which
   is euqal or lower than the current building, at the end, return the stack
1. EPI8.6 Compute binary tree nodes in order of depth  
   *For given binary tree, return a list of keys at the same level, from left to right*
   ***
   using an array (as a queue), from root, load current level's nodes from left to right into the queue,
   get their keys, then clear the queue, load next level (from left to right) until there is no node in 
   current level.  
   list comprehension was used when generating next level node list from parent nodes:  
   node_list = [child for node in node_list for child in [node.left, node.right] if child]  
   there are many variants of the issue
   * return the keys in top-down manner, from left to right or right to left, same as above?
   * return the keys in bottom-up manner, left to right order, using a stack for top-down, then pop?
   * return the average of keys at each level, same as the main problem?
1. EPI8.7 Implement a circular queue  
   *Using array to implement queue, supporting head/tail, dynamic resizing*
   ***
   for the queue class, beside data field, there are head, tail and count fields, need to make sure
   1. it is circular queue, then head and tail should modular data length
   1. in case the queue is full, increase the data size by constant SCALE_FACTOR
1. EPI8.8 Implement a queue using stacks  
   *using two stacks*
   ***
   one stack for enqueue and another stack for dequeue, note only transfer element from enque to deque when
   deque is empty
1. EPI8.9 Implement a queue with max API  
   *Implement a queue class with enque, deque and max operations*
   ***
   when doing deque, in order to find the max element quickly (instead of the O(N) time complexity), keep
   an extra queue max_queue, when new element added into main_queue, we will scan the max_queue from right
   to left, for all elements smaller than the current element, we discard them; when element removed from 
   main_queue, we compare it with head of max_queue, if equal, we remove the head.  
   the max_queue can be implemented by collections.deque
