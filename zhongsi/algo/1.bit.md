## bit operation 
bitwise operation, bit manipulation, 位操作, 位运算

### python int 2's complement binary representation
for 0 and every positive number, 2's complement notation is the same as its 
classical binary representation
for negative number, -x is represented by bit pattern of (x-1), then with
all the bits complemented (switch from 1 to 0 and 0 to 1)
so -1 is repsented as 1111 (if we use 4 bits as limit)
since there is no bit limit for python 3 int, it can be written as ...111..1,
unlimited 1s
for the same reason, there are unlimited 0s in the beginning of positive int,
like 5 could be ...000..01001

### bitwise operator
x << y, shift to the left by y bits (new bits are 0s), like x * pow(2, y)
x >> y, shift to the right by y bits, like x // pow(2, y), // is floor division
x & y, bitwise and
x | y, bitwise or
~x, complement of x, switch each bit to its complement, 1 to 0 and 0 to 1
x ^ y, bitwise exclusive or, each bit of the output is the same as corresponding
bit in x if that bit in y is 0, and is the complement of the bit of x if that
bit in y is 1

all operations should apply communtative and associative properties

positive and negative, consider their 2's complement representation
<< and >> don't change int positive or negative
positive & negative results positive
positive | negative results negative
~x actually equals -(x + 1)
positive ^ negative results negative
