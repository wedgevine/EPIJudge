### python int 2's complement binary representation
for 0 and every positive number, 2's complement notation is the same as its 
classical binary representation
for negative number, -x is represented by bit pattern of (x-1), then with
all the bits complemented (switch from 1 to 0 and 0 to 1)
so -1 is repsented as 1111 (if we use 4 bits as limit)
since there is no bit limit for python 3 int, it can be written as ...111..1,
unlimited 1s
for the same reason, there are unlimited 0s in the beginning of positive int,
like 5 could be ...000..01001

### bitwise operator
* x << y, shift to the left by y bits (new bits are 0s), like x * pow(2, y)
* x >> y, shift to the right by y bits, like x // pow(2, y), // is floor division
* x & y, bitwise and
* x | y, bitwise or
* ~x, complement of x, switch each bit to its complement, 1 to 0 and 0 to 1
* x ^ y, bitwise exclusive or, each bit of the output is the same as corresponding
bit in x if that bit in y is 0, and is the complement of the bit of x if that
bit in y is 1

all operations should apply communtative and associative properties

positive and negative, consider their 2's complement representation
* << and >> don't change int positive or negative
* positive & negative results positive
* positive | negative results negative
* ~x actually equals -(x + 1)
* positive ^ negative results negative

### trick
1. clear the lowest set bit   
   x = 0b1..10..0, x - 1 = 0b1..01..1, then x & (x - 1)
2. extract the lowest set bit   
   x = 0b1..10..0, x - 1 = 0b1..01..1, ~(x - 1) = 0b0..10..0, then x & ~(x - 1)
   note by definition, -x = ~(x - 1), so x & (-x)it means ~x = -(x + 1)
3. set the lowermost 0   
   x = 0b1..101..1, x + 1 = 0b1..110..0, then x | (x + 1)
4. right propagate the rightmost set bit  
   x = 0b1..110..0, x - 1 = 0b1..101..1, x ^ (x - 1) = 0b0..011..1, then x ^ (x - 1) | x
5. compute x modulo a power of 2  
   y = 0b10..0, power of 2, y = 2 ^ n, equals strip last n bits of x, eqauls x & (y - 1)
6. test x is power of 2  
   x != 0 and x & (x - 1) == 0
